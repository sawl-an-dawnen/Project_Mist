Lesson: Introduces timed inversion traversal.

Puzzle 3 ‚Äî Stone and Spores

Concept: Weight shift.
Setting: Heavy stone (normal) and light mushroom cap (inverted).
Goal: Carry a stone across a log; invert to lighten and jump higher.
Lesson: Objects change physics with inversion.

Puzzle 4 ‚Äî Vine Ladder

Concept: Split ladder traversal.
Setting: Broken vine ladder hanging from a tree.
Goal: Climb up, invert mid-way to grab onto shadow vines.
Lesson: Teach inversion timing while in motion.

Puzzle 5 ‚Äî The Vanishing Bridge

Concept: Tangibility toggling.
Setting: Fallen tree bridge visible in daylight state; ghost bridge at night.
Goal: Invert to bypass branches or low-hanging vines.
Lesson: Blend traversal with obstacle management.

Puzzle 6 ‚Äî Buried Path

Concept: Reveal hidden routes.
Setting: Overgrown clearing with hidden stone steps beneath the grass (visible only when inverted).
Goal: Invert to reveal path downward into ruins.
Lesson: Environmental storytelling + discovery via inversion.

üèôÔ∏è CITY STREETS (Medium / Intermediate Tier)

Theme: Abandoned city in twilight; mechanical and societal decay.

Adds pressure plates, timing, multi-object puzzles.

Objects become manmade: crates, switches, traffic barriers, streetlamps.

Puzzles feel like ‚Äúreactivating‚Äù or navigating old machinery.

Puzzle 7 ‚Äî Power Switch

Concept: Pressure plate basics.
Setting: Streetlight-controlled gate.
Goal: Place a crate on a floor switch to open a shutter.
Lesson: Interaction between weight and mechanism.

Puzzle 8 ‚Äî The Vanishing Crate

Concept: State-dependent pressure.
Setting: Old delivery box disappears when inverted (light flickers out).
Goal: Use crate to open door, invert to pass before it vanishes.
Lesson: Timing and awareness of inversion persistence.

Puzzle 9 ‚Äî Two-State Circuit

Concept: Multi-state plate logic.
Setting: Power panels connected to neon conduits.
Goal: One circuit activates in normal mode, the other in inverted; both must power a gate simultaneously.
Lesson: Alternating logic ‚Äî planning around dual activation.

Puzzle 10 ‚Äî Ghost Alley

Concept: Phasing through solid objects.
Setting: Crumbling city wall that only exists in daylight.
Goal: Invert mid-jump to pass through the barrier and land on inverted fire escapes.
Lesson: Traversal using phase transitions.

Puzzle 11 ‚Äî Anti-Gravity Sign

Concept: Gravity inversion with visibility.
Setting: A floating street sign or billboard that reverses gravity when inverted.
Goal: Use it to lift yourself upward to a higher ledge.
Lesson: Combine inversion + physical forces.

Puzzle 12 ‚Äî The Vanishing Box Trick

Concept: Object juggling between states.
Setting: Two boxes: one real-world delivery box, one ghostly holographic crate.
Goal: Place one to hold a gate open, invert to activate the second and continue.
Lesson: Manage multiple object states simultaneously.

Puzzle 13 ‚Äî The Chain Reaction

Concept: Cascading consequences.
Setting: Old city power substation with pressure plates and magnetic locks.
Goal: One inversion deactivates a magnetic hold, freeing a floating object that triggers another plate.
Lesson: Understand domino-style inversion events.

‚öôÔ∏è FACTORY (Hard / Advanced Tier)

Theme: Industrial labyrinth of gears, electricity, and unstable physics.

Complex puzzles combining gravity, inversion, timing, and multiple objects.

Feels like controlling or restoring the heart of a dead machine.

Objects: gears, pistons, conveyor belts, magnetic boxes, turbines.

Puzzle 14 ‚Äî Layered Presses

Concept: Multi-layer plate logic.
Setting: Factory floor with stacked conveyor systems.
Goal: Some plates exist only in normal mode; others only in inverted. Use crates strategically across both.
Lesson: Thinking in parallel dimensions.

Puzzle 15 ‚Äî Gravity Leap

Concept: Inversion-assisted movement.
Setting: Lift platform above molten metal vat.
Goal: Grab a reverse-gravity crate, invert mid-jump to be pulled upward onto a catwalk.
Lesson: Combines gravity, inversion, and traversal timing.

Puzzle 16 ‚Äî The Sacrifice

Concept: Emotional & mechanical payoff.
Setting: Reactor core door powered by a glowing energy orb.
Goal: Leave orb on a plate to keep door open, but inversion causes it to vanish ‚Äî find alternate route to escape.
Lesson: Consequence and permanent choice.

Puzzle 17 ‚Äî Magnetic Inversion

Concept: Polarity reversal.
Setting: Electromagnets change pull/push based on inversion.
Goal: Use inversion bursts to sling a metal ball into a socket.
Lesson: Motion and polarity mastery.

Puzzle 18 ‚Äî Inversion Conveyor

Concept: Directional state shifts.
Setting: Assembly line where belts switch direction on inversion.
Goal: Push parts onto belts, invert timing to deliver them precisely to switches.
Lesson: Controlled environment dynamics.

Puzzle 19 ‚Äî Cascading Core

Concept: Rapid multi-switch timing.
Setting: Factory reactor with gates, pistons, and pressure plates activating differently per state.
Goal: Sprint through a gauntlet, chaining inversions in sync with machine rhythm.
Lesson: Reflex-based logic.

Puzzle 20 ‚Äî Mirror Foundry (Finale)

Concept: Full mastery.
Setting: Split-level machine chamber ‚Äî one side active in normal mode, the other in inverted.
